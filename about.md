	<img src="{{ '/assets/img/antony.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="">
	<p class="intro">I am a 25 years old French engineer living in Sydney for both personal and professional development. I have full rights to work in Australia, up to 6 months for the same company according to the current Working Holiday Visa legislation.
Graduated in Mathematics and Computer Science, I am truly passionate about Analytics and Data Science. Since 2015, I have been working on various data-oriented projects, mainly on top of Hadoop ecosystems. As a consultant, I have worked on different environments, which have enabled me to understand how to succeed in implementing Big Data projects from conception right through to delivery and acceptance.
Being proactive and curious helps me to keep updated of recent Frameworks and tools used by Data Scientists or Data Engineers. I have been in charge of a Data Lab for my last company, Sogeti, it was an occasion to share knowledge and skills on Big Data, IA, Cognitive Science and other Analytic subjects.</p>
