Today's event is a talk done by Eugene Dubossarsky on Data Science Management and Strategy Stream (DSS-M&S). Google's 
conference room is full of Data Analysts, Engineers or Scientists. Still a few managers are here and they should listen
carefully because they are the targeted audience.

# The important things: What managers Must Know About Data Science

Opening : Eugene introduces *Presciient*, a training company on Data Analytics. They propose interesting classes on
Machine Learning, Statistics and programming. Next year they will open two new courses on Quantum computing, which
already sounds like the next trendy subject. 

This article is a simple transcription of what I have understood of Eugene's speak. 

## Data Science challenge in 2017

The biggest challenge in analytics is not about technologies or the technical skill but it is on the organisation side.
In large corporations or governments the organisation system does not help to solve the problem. It is one the 
managerial side.
 
Why Data Science performs in start-ups and struggles in large organisations? Data Science is all about uncertainty, and it is something management person do not like.

> Data Science (Analytics) exist for only one purpose: better decision making.

From the perspective of the organisation Data Science is a product. And there are only two ways to use this product. 
We can either sell the data or use the data to solve our own problem. Selling the data is not the most
interesting choice for data science teams. If you are a Data Scientist in a large organisation, you
bring much more value if you do your job on internal subjects because you will participate in solving problem. 


## Give your Data Scientists the right tools to do their job

In the late 90s, people used to thing about computer guys as weird, geek, nerd. Now almost everybody is a computer person.
How much our knowledge is about computer? You are more likely to know to solve computer issue than a real life problem.
Data Science may be changing the world as the computer is changing it for 20 years. Also, it is today overrated
as computer have been overrated 20 years ago.

> The churn rate in data science is very high. Mainly because of management, because someone hired Data Scientist 
expecting that their are going to solve their problem without providing access to the data.

There is no point in hiring 20 Data Scientist without a single Data Engineer to support them, or without performing,
computers, well thought business framework or cloud computing access.

Data Scientist make better tools to know what better is. They know which KPI to highlight. 


## The Data Science mystery


Statistics is about being precise with uncertainty. This is why we can not expect what the analysitcs team is going to
find. If you want to be a good analyst you have to try to measure uncertainty the best that you can. 
 

> The ideal manager is an analytics customer. 

You want your boss to make decision about the analytics you are doing. Problem is that today's data scientist boss are
more often commercial that just need to show that Data Science is cool.
Be more concern about solving a problem, you should understand what the solution look like. It has to be
good for your business. Would you want you're problem solve? 

*About Automation*

Software developers are not disappearing at all, we need even more clever Software engineer to understand all the
complexity brought by the multiple amount of new packages and resources.
AutoML will not replace Data Scientist, it is a myth, it will increase the need of Data Scientist.

##  Conclusion

Eugene speech has been very clear and inspiring. Too often Data Scientists feel limited in the scope of their action
and this is something that management should solve because the analytics team will definitely show its value to the
organisation, improve the product or the service, but also improve the customer experience.
