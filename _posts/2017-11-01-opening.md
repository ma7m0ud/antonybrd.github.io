I recently moved from Toulouse, France, to Sydney, and decided to create a personal website.

# Starting a new life 

A fresh start often come with brand new good intentions. Obviously, you are more likely to follow these
new intentions than the traditional New Year's Resolution for many reasons. The most important reason
is that you do not have any habits, and you have plenty of time. 

One says that writing blog articles is a good way to improve your written english. I believe that
you can not become good at something without training so let's start this blog and see if it works or not.

## What is the purpose of this blog

I am a Data Engineer, but also a Data Scientist. If I want to keep doing it the right way I need to know what are the new
framework and tools of the moment. Working in Computer Science requires to have a flexible skill set and to be able to learn
new things quickly. Take a look at this *awesome* list of [Data Engineering tool](https://github.com/igorbarinov/awesome-data-engineering)
to understand how huge is the Big Data landscape today. 

Writing a blog post on a tool, or a technology force you to do some research about it and to understand it
more deeply. 

## Getting a new Job

Arriving in Sydney, I have been looking for a new job. As a consequence, I passed a lot of job interviews, and I had to answer
to many questions. Those questions help you to understand what your future employer wants, what skill is the most widely used
at the moment. Also, you have a preview of what models or techniques are already used in the industry. For example, in
2017, established companies start using Deep Learning with Tensorflow but they are not really aware of GAN.

Looking for a new job was a really great experience, I have been learning a lot and this blog will help ma to keep a
trace of what I have learn.

## Participating in various event

It may also be a positive habit to write articles about the events you can go (Meet-up, professional training,
presentations, etc).
